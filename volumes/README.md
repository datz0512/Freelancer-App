## Run docker compose services

These services are required to be executed first with so as to prevent errors when you start your microservices.

- `redis`
  - `docker compose up -d redis`
- `mongodb`
  - `docker compose up -d mongodb`
- `mysql`
  - `docker compose up -d mysql`
- `postgres`
  - `docker compose up -d postgres`
- `rabbitmq`
  - `docker compose up -d redis`
- `elasticsearch`
  - `docker compose up -d elasticsearch`
  - It could take somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes for elasticsearch to be running.

## Setting up Kibana

- Using a kibana docker image greater than 8.10.x, the setup is a bit different.
- Once elasticsearch is running, open the elasticsearch container terminal and change the password of kibana_system
  - `curl -s -X POST -u elastic:admin1234 -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:9200/_security/user/kibana_system/_password -d "{\"password\":\"kibana\"}"`
  - If the update was successful, you should see a `{}` displayed in the terminal.
- Also from the elasticsearch container terminal, create a kibana service token
  - `bin/elasticsearch-service-tokens create elastic/kibana freelancer-kibana`
  - If the service account token was generated, it will be displayed.
  - Once generated, copy and add it to the kibana environment variable `ELASTICSEARCH_SERVICEACCOUNT_TOKEN` inside your docker compose file

## Heartbeat file

- Replace my ip address with your own ip address inside the `heartbeat.yml`.

## Running microservices

- You can run the microservices using either docker compose or by opening a terminal for wach service and execute `npm run dev`.
- Personally, I prefer to run the microservices individually in the terminal because it allows me to easily monitor errors displayed.
- Whichever approach you intend to use to start the microservices, make sure the `gateway service` is always the last service you start. All other services should be running before starting the `gateway service`.
